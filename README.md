# PSoC 6 MCU: USB HID Generic Application

This example demonstrates how to configure the USB block in a PSoC 6 MCU as a Human Interface Device (HID). The device enumerates as a Generic HID device.

## Overview

This code example shows how to set up a USB HID descriptor to transfer any type of data. After the device enumerates, the User LED turns on. In the main loop, firmware waits to receive data from the host, and sends back the same data.

To see the generic 64-byte HID descriptor, use the **usbdev-configurator** tool located at *<ModusToolbox_install_dir>/tools_\<version\>/usbdev-configurator*. In the tool, open the *design.cyusbdev* file located under the */COMPONENT_CUSTOM_DESIGN_MODUS/TARGET_\<BSP\>* folder.

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note**: The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

This example requires a USB host tool to write and read data to/from a HID device. Instructions in this document use this [tool](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/USB-HID-Tool).

Download the GitHub project available in this [link](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/USB-HID-Tool/archive/master.zip). You should see a */bin* folder that contains the **usbhidtool** executable available for different systems.

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the Quick Panel (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**).

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the **Library Manager** to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, right-click the application name from the Project Workspace window in the IDE, and select **ModusToolbox** > **Library Manager**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog, choose the example.

4. Optionally, update the **Application Name:** and **Location** fields with the application name and local path where application is created.

5. Click **Create** and complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder. On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, navigate to the modus-shell directory (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell*) and run Cygwin.bat.

3. Import required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow instructions from the CLI section to download or clone the repository, and import libraries using `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

3. Follow instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For more details, see *Exporting to IDEs* section of the ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

2. Program the board.

   ### Using ModusToolbox IDE:

   1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

   2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3)**.

   ### Using CLI:

   1. From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```
        Example:

        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```
        **Note**:  Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

3. Connect another USB cable (or reuse the same cable used to program the kit) to the USB device connector (refer to the kit user guide for its location). Check if the User LED turns on after enumeration.

4. On the computer, open a terminal console and run the *usbhidtool* to send a few bytes. The tool requires as argument the VID, PID, number of bytes to send and data. Refer to [this](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/USB-HID-Tool/blob/master/README.md) documentation or use the example below.

   ### In Windows:
   ```
   usbhidtool.exe 0x04B4 0xE17E 4 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF     
   ```

   ### In Linux:
   ```
   ./usbhidtool 0x04B4 0xE17E 4 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF     
   ```

5. After writing to the device, you should see the same data written back to the terminal console.
   ```
   de ad be ef 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
   ```
**Note** The *usbhidtool* always sends 64 bytes to the device, independently of how may bytes provided. Any remaining data is written with zeros.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see *Program and Debug* section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide: *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*.

## Design and Implementation

In the main firmware routine, the USB Device block is configured to use the HID Device Class. After enumeration, the device turns on the User LED and continuously checks if any data is available to read. If it is, the application copies the available data to a local buffer, and then writes the same data back to the USB host. The read and write USB functions used in this example are blocking. The User LED briefly turns off when receiving/sending data. The device goes to sleep when no data is available.
